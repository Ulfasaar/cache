# Cache

This simple library implements a lazy refreshed, in memory caching system, that is easy and simple to use

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This library is currently in a alpha state and is prone to frequent breaking changes.

## Usage

To use this library for now just downlad the file inside the dist folder for your particular platform and then import it as if it was a class you wrote yourself.

If your target is not in the dist folder then feel free to clone the repo and adjust the Build.hxml file to compile to
your target. The comments in said file show some examples for how to compile to different targets that haxe supports.

## Todo

- Move all the distributions to the platforms package managers eg: NPM, pip etc
